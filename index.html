She cooks the broth for many hours to make it tasty. I also like banh mi, a Vietnamese sandwich with meat, vegetables, and sauce. For breakfast, I usually eat sticky rice with mung beans or peanuts. Sometimes I have bread with butter and jam. At lunch, I prefer rice with grilled fish, vegetables, and soup. My favorite fruit is mango because it is sweet and juicy. I also like bananas, apples, and oranges. For snacks, I enjoy eating crackers, cookies, and sometimes ice cream. When I visit my friends, their mothers often give me different foods to try. I have tasted Chinese noodles, Japanese sushi, and Korean kimchi. All foods are interesting, but I still love Vietnamese cuisine the most. Good food makes me happy and gives me energy to study and play.

                    Every Sunday, my family cooks together. It is one of our favorite traditions. My mother is the main cook, but everyone helps. My father is good at cutting vegetables and preparing meat. My sister helps wash the rice and vegetables. I usually help set the table and carry dishes. First, we plan what to cook for the week. We look at recipes and decide on the menu. Then we go shopping for ingredients at the local market. We buy fresh vegetables, meat, fish, and spices. When we come home, we start cooking together. My mother teaches us how to make different dishes. Last week, we learned to make spring rolls. It was fun wrapping the rice paper with vegetables and shrimp. We also made fried rice with eggs and vegetables. While cooking, we talk and laugh together. The kitchen becomes full of delicious smells. When the food is ready, we eat together and share stories about our week. Cooking together makes our family closer and teaches me valuable life skills.

                    I love animals very much. At home, we have a small dog named Lucky. Lucky is brown and white with long ears and a short tail. He is very friendly and loves to play with children. Every morning, Lucky wakes me up by licking my face. He follows me everywhere I go. We also have two cats, Mimi and Coco. They are sisters and look very similar. They like to sleep in sunny spots and chase butterflies in the garden. My favorite wild animals are elephants and tigers. I think elephants are very intelligent and gentle. They take care of their families just like humans do. Tigers are beautiful but dangerous. They are strong and fast hunters. At the zoo, I also like to see monkeys, giraffes, and colorful birds. Monkeys are funny and playful. Giraffes are very tall and eat leaves from high trees. Birds can fly and sing beautiful songs. I believe all animals deserve our love and protection. We should take care of them and their homes in nature.

                    Nature is everywhere around us and it is very beautiful. In my neighborhood, there are many tall trees that provide shade and fresh air. The trees have green leaves and sometimes colorful flowers. Birds make their nests in the branches and sing lovely songs. In spring, new flowers bloom in gardens and parks. I love to see red roses, yellow sunflowers, and purple orchids. The flowers smell wonderful and attract bees and butterflies. Near my house, there is a small pond with clear water. Fish swim in the pond and frogs jump on the lily pads. At night, I can hear crickets singing and see fireflies glowing in the dark. During summer, it often rains and everything becomes fresh and green. The air smells clean after the rain. Mountains in the distance look blue and peaceful. Rivers flow quietly through the countryside. All these natural things make me feel happy and calm. I think we should protect nature and keep our environment clean for future generations.

                    Vietnam has two main seasons, but I like to learn about all four seasons. Spring is a beautiful time when flowers bloom and trees grow new leaves. The weather is warm and pleasant. Many people go to parks and gardens to enjoy the fresh air. Summer is hot and sunny. Children love summer because they have long holidays from school. We can go swimming, play outdoor games, and eat ice cream. Sometimes it rains heavily in summer, but the rain cools down the temperature. Autumn is cool and comfortable. Leaves change colors from green to yellow, orange, and red. It is a good time for outdoor activities like hiking and camping. Winter is cold in some countries, but not in Vietnam. In winter, people wear warm clothes and drink hot tea or coffee. They stay inside more often and spend time with family. Each season has its own beauty and special activities. I think all seasons are wonderful in their own way. Weather changes make life interesting and help us appreciate different times of the year.

                    Different types of weather make us do different activities. On sunny days, I like to play outside with my friends. We can play soccer, ride bicycles, or have picnics in the park. The sunshine makes everything bright and cheerful. My mother hangs clothes outside to dry in the sun. On rainy days, we stay inside and find indoor activities. I like to read books, draw pictures, or help my mother cook. The sound of rain on the roof is very relaxing. Sometimes we sit by the window and watch the rain fall. On windy days, children love to fly kites in open spaces. The wind carries the kites high up in the sky. It is exciting to see colorful kites dancing in the air. On cloudy days, the sky looks gray and peaceful. The temperature is usually cooler, which is nice for walking or doing outdoor work. Hot weather makes us want to stay in the shade and drink cold water. Cold weather makes us want to wear warm clothes and drink hot drinks. Each type of weather brings its own joy and activities.

I want to help children learn English and communicate with people from other countries. I think speaking English opens many opportunities in life. To achieve this goal, I study English every day and practice speaking with my friends. I also read English books and watch English movies. Another dream is to travel around the world and see different places. I want to visit famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower in France and the Great Wall of China. I hope to meet people from different cultures and learn about their customs. I also dream of helping poor children get education. I want to build schools and libraries in remote areas. Education is very important for everyone's future. In the near future, I want to be the best student in my class. I will study hard and participate in school activities. I also want to learn to play the piano and speak Chinese. These dreams motivate me to work hard every day and never give up.

I can now read longer texts and understand new vocabulary. My pronunciation has improved, and I feel more confident speaking English. I have learned about many interesting topics like family, school, hobbies, food, animals, nature, weather, and dreams. Each story has helped me understand the world better. I have also learned that practice makes perfect. The more I read and speak, the better I become. I want to continue learning English even after this program ends. I will keep reading English books and watching English programs on TV. I also want to make friends with English-speaking people online. My teacher says that learning never stops, and I agree. There is always something new to discover and learn. I am grateful for this opportunity to improve my English skills. I hope other students will also enjoy learning English as much as I do. Thank you for joining me on this wonderful learning adventure. Let's keep learning and growing together!
